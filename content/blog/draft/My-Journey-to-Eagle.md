Over the past 12 years, I've been involved in the [Boy Scouts of America](https://scouting.org). I've gone from a Tiger in elementary school to an Eagle Scout in High School. I've poured thousands of hours in both volunteering and camping, both as part of the main BSA program and the OA, and I've gone to the largest Scouting event in the world, the World Scout Jamboree. As I've now reached the pinnacle of the Scouts BSA program, I figured it would be a good idea to reflect on what brought me here, and where to go.

## Cub Scouts
I started my journey as a Tiger Scout. There's not much that happened here, except for MassJam 2013, which was my first really big event as a Scout. I credit this event with first getting me into amateur radio.

## Boy Scouts
In 2014, I "crossed over" from Cub Scouts into Boy Scouts. My scoutmaster at the time was Scoutmaster Dude. Dude was my scoutmaster for several years, and he oversaw my journey from Scout to Life, which, for those unaware, is the majority of the ranking system. At that point there was only one rank left, Eagle Scout.

At that point, my troop changed scoutmasters. The new scoutmaster had a... *different* approach to running a troop. Scoutmaster Dude was more focused on himself planning outings that we would all have fun on, while the new Scoutmaster was a lot more focused on us as youth planning all of our trips. By this time, I was one of the more senior scouts in the troop, and already hard at work on my Eagle Scout rank.

In the summer of 2017, my then-Senior Patrol Leader agreed to appoint me as Troop OA Representative. This was the first appointment in a series that would leave me in 2020 holding four leadership positions within the troop. I was already the troop Webmaster, but that fall I was appointed Scribe, then Troop Guide in 2019. Through these positions I've gained the confidence to carry out my plans (and actually plan).

### The Order of the Arrow
In the fall of 2017, I completed my Ordeal and was inducted into the [Order of the Arrow](https://oa-bsa.org). That sparked my membership in an amazing organization that's shown me the power of cheerful service to others. In 2019, I worked on the New England Fellowship Shows Committee, and I was offered the ability to be the 2020 Shows Fellowship Coordinator. The 2020 NEF has, sadly, been cancelled, but I still gained valuable experience.
