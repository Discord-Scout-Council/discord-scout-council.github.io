I figured I'd take a leaf out of other people's books and start doing monthly status updates (if I remember to do them). For the first month, I'll be talking about Campmaster Constantine, Discord Scout Council, and this site.

## Campmaster Constantine
This month has seen a lot of changes, from PostgreSQL to task scheduling. I'm currently in the process of adding server mute functionality based off of the task scheduler I wrote (found [here](https://git.sr.ht/~muirrum/campmasterconstantine/tree/feature/queue)). Also upcoming are reminders and timed bans. If you have any suggestions for what I can do with this, feel free to drop a note in my public inbox (found in the sidebar).

I'm also working on a secret for the Campmaster, that's coming up, so stay tuned!

## Discord Scout Council
I've recently joined the Discord Scout Council as the representative for Camp Quarantine, and as the Tech Team lead. I'm currently working on maintaining their [bot](https://github.com/Discord-Scout-Council/DSC-Bot) and creating their website. I'm excited to be working with them, and I'm looking forward to creating their website and bot.

## devosmium.xyz
This site recently went through yet another revamp. This time, it's using a [theme](https://git.sr.ht/~tristan957/tristan.partin.io) written by [Tristan Partin](https://tristan.partin.io). I'm planning on reworking the theme a bit, but this works for now. I also added an [about](about/) page to the site.

As the Campmaster grows, I'm planning on creating documentation for it here.
