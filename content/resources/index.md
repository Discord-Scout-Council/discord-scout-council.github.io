# Unit Support
With scouts around the world needing to adapt, overcome and survive having an access point for scouts online that they are used to is incredibly important. So we're here to help you set up a Discord server/guild for your scout group, and assist you along the way. We want to make sure this server is perfect for you, so we would love it if you could fill out our form so we know what we need to do. We'll be in touch with you as possible we can. <insert link here>
